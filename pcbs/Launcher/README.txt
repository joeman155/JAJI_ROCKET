These files are PCB designs of circuits to launch rockets. These are
shields that will fit on a Freetronics EtherMega

Rocket_End - Signifies PCBS that reside in electronics at end where 
             rocket is.

Operator_End - (No files as of yet)



The second part indicates the main component on them.
- Relays  - Means relays to perform launch sequence 
 [There is also facility for camera and RFD900 module]

- Sensors - A pile of sensors that might be useful
 [Sensors/devices include CopernicusGPS, RTC, IMU, Air pressure measurement]
  
 

As you can appreciate for normal launch sequence, only the 'Relays' shield is
required. However, for a Rockoon, at will be advantegous to have a 'Sensors'
shield installed as well to help collect other information (GPS, IMU, 
air pressure, temp, etc)
